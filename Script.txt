Varying according to such facto rs as the so cial cl ass o f the hunters and the species o f the hunted, many hunting disco urses, for ex ample, describe the dead bodies o f ‘game’ as the ‘catch,’ ‘bag,’ ‘yield,’ ‘take’ and ‘harvest.’ Specialty hunting often requires speci alty lang uage.

Animals killed by the mili tary are referred to as ‘collateral damage’. Animals are ‘humanel y’ killed and ‘put to sleep’ and ‘euthanised’ in ‘shelters’ under the guise o f ‘pest co ntro l’ and ‘nuisance avo idance’. But new tastes were cultivated. New regimes were invented and po wer applied at new sites of human do mini o n.

The intentio n behind this relo cation was that, in the transfo rmatio n o f li ving beings into edible co mmodities, there sho uld be a di sasso ci atio n between, on the o ne hand, the killing of animals (‘slaughter’) and, o n the o ther, the carving up of their bo dies and the draining of their blo o d (‘butchery’). The twelf th-century English wo rd ‘slaughter,’ thi rd, originally referred to the killing of bo th humans and animals, o ften on a large scale and with blo o d aplenty Old Norse slather, Icel andic slátr).
